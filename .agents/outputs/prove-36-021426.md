# PROVE: Issue #36 -- OCR Postprocessing

## Executive Summary

All 21 unit tests for the OCR postprocessing module pass. The full test suite (533 tests) passes with zero failures and zero regressions. All 8 acceptance criteria from the MAP-PLAN are met. The implementation correctly applies the four SPEC 11.2 step 6 operations and uses only stdlib dependencies.

## Verification Results

### Test Execution

| Suite | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `test_ocr_postprocess.py` (21 tests) | 21 passed in 0.14s |
| Full suite `packages/ingestkit-pdf/tests/` | 533 passed in 1.92s |
| Regressions | 0 |

### Import Verification

`postprocess_ocr_text` is importable from `ingestkit_pdf.utils` -- confirmed via direct import test.

## Acceptance Criteria

| # | Criterion | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | `postprocess_ocr_text()` importable from `ingestkit_pdf.utils` | PASS |
| 2 | All four SPEC 11.2 step 6 operations implemented | PASS |
| 3 | Clean text passes through unchanged (T20) | PASS |
| 4 | Empty/whitespace-only input returns empty string (T19) | PASS |
| 5 | No external dependencies -- only `re`, `unicodedata`, `logging` from stdlib | PASS |
| 6 | Logger uses `ingestkit_pdf` namespace (`ingestkit_pdf.utils.ocr_postprocess`) | PASS |
| 7 | All test cases pass, no regressions | PASS |
| 8 | Module docstring references SPEC 11.2 step 6 | PASS |

## Comparison with PATCH

All PATCH claims verified. No discrepancies found.

Note: PATCH reported 485 passed + 1 skipped for the full suite. Current run shows 533 passed + 0 skipped. The increase is expected -- other issues (28-35) were implemented between PATCH execution and this PROVE run, adding tests. The key point is zero failures and zero regressions.

## Compliance Checklist

- [x] Function-based design, no ABC or class hierarchy
- [x] Logger namespace: `ingestkit_pdf.utils.ocr_postprocess`
- [x] Module docstring references SPEC 11.2 step 6
- [x] `from __future__ import annotations` present
- [x] Compiled regex patterns at module level
- [x] PLAN-CHECK advisory applied: `[a-zA-Z]` used instead of `\w` in hyphen regex
- [x] `__init__.py` export added alongside existing exports
- [x] All tests marked `@pytest.mark.unit`

## Issues Found

None.

## Recommendation

**APPROVED** -- Implementation is complete, all tests pass, no regressions. Ready for PR.
